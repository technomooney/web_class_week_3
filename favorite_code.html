    <h1>Edited and converted a python program to work and look better</h1>
    <p>I found a playstation discord presence program to display what im playing on my Playstation on discord.
    It worked. but it was messy as can be. it also did not have any logging functionality which I wanted.
    I forked it and did a lot of code restructuring. I will show some of what I did here.</p>
    <p>the GitHub for the original work is <a href="https://github.com/elsorino/playstationpresence"
                                              rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">here</a></p>

    <div>
        <p>Well one thing I did was get rid of the way this person was looking for the data they needed in the json response
        that was returned by playstation's api</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>here is an example of what they did. first they would get the data from the Playstation network api and
        convert the data returned into a flat string like this
        <pre><code>mainpresence = str(user_online_id.get_presence())</code></pre></p>
        <p>
        then they would do split that so they could itterate on it. like this:
        <pre><code>current = mainpresence.split("'")</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
        then they would look for specific data in the split list or use a specific element index to find a specific piece
        of date the program wanted to display. code: <pre><code>            if (len(current) == 19): #Length of this is 19 if user is not in a game
                rpc.update(state="Idling", start=start_time, small_image=system, small_text=PSNID, large_image=system, large_text="Homescreen")
                print("Idling")
            else:
                if 'gameStatus' in mainpresence: #Not every game supports gameStatus
                    gametext = current[39]
                else:
                    gametext = current[27]
                if gameart == "yes":
                    gameid = current[23]
                else:
                    gameid = system
                gamename = current[27]</code></pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            Sure that is quick and dirty and gets the job done. but what happens if the api changes and the size is different?
            note that this also does not display any custom artwork for the game being played even though the api returns
            a link to the relevant image for the game being played. I wanted that to work as well so, I did just that.
        </p>
    </div>

        <p>
            first I got rid of the code that "flattened" the json data. in python a json data structure is identical to a
            dictionary data type. So I just had to remove the <code>str()</code> function around the code that called to
            the api. that was easy. now I had to reverse engineer the data in the api because I was not familiar with
            it at all. luckily that was not too hard. after I did that I converted the logic to use the json data and
            directly grab for the elements I needed. example:
        <pre><code>                    if len(mainpresence) == 2: #Length of this is 19 if user is not in a game
                    rpc.update(state="Idling", start=start_time, small_image=system, small_text=PSNID, large_image=system, large_text="Homescreen")
                    logging.info(f'Idleing')
                    print("Idling")
                else:
                    if 'gameStatus' in mainpresence['gameTitleInfoList'][0]: #Not every game supports gameStatus
                        gametext = mainpresence['gameTitleInfoList'][0]['gameStatus']
                    else:
                        gametext = mainpresence['gameTitleInfoList'][0]['titleName']
                    if gameart == "yes":
                        if 'conceptIconUrl' in mainpresence['gameTitleInfoList'][0]:
                            gameid = mainpresence['gameTitleInfoList'][0]["conceptIconUrl"]
                        elif "npTitleIconUrl" in mainpresence['gameTitleInfoList'][0]:
                            gameid = mainpresence['gameTitleInfoList'][0]["npTitleIconUrl"]

                    else:
                        gameid = system
                    gamename = mainpresence['gameTitleInfoList'][0]['titleName']</code></pre>
        <em>yes</em>... I <em>know</em> some comments are not correct.
        </p>
        <p>
            anyway I also added some logging, and I made the code accept command line arguments for the logging file.
            I plan on adding functionality that allows it to be run as a service in the background with a heart beat signal system
            so when it dies it can be restarted automatically by a service manager like systemd or Windows services.
            but that is a long ways away yet.
